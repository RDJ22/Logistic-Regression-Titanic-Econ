Logistic regression on Titanic data: gradient derivation, sklearn implementation, cross-validation, and performance metrics.
# Logistic Regression for Binary Classification (Titanic Dataset)

This repository contains two parts of a project focused on understanding and applying logistic regression for binary classification using Python, both theoretically and practically using the Titanic dataset.

---

## Project Overview

> This project explores logistic regression from both a theoretical and practical perspective. In the first part, the gradient of the log-likelihood function is derived and gradient descent is applied to optimize coefficients. The second part implements logistic regression using Python's `scikit-learn` to predict survival outcomes on the Titanic dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, and evaluation using common classification metrics and ROC analysis.

- Derived the gradient vector of the logistic regression log-likelihood function
- Demonstrated gradient descent for iterative optimization
- Preprocessed the Titanic dataset (handling missing values, encoding categoricals)
- Applied logistic regression using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluated model with:
  Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC curve and AUC
